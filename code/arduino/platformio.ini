; This looks fishy, but it's because platformio "loses" one directory level:
; For example, say we have the following directory structure:
; - my-libs/libname/subname/hello.h
; If we add my-libs here, I want to be able to:
; #include "libname/subname/hello.h"
; But that does not happen. I would have to do:
; #include "subname/hello.h"
; (Note how the "libname/" disappeared).
; I don't like that very much, so I use the hack of, instead including
; my-libs/ here, I include my-libs's parent directory.
